The project focuses on analyzing the Nigerian car sales data. The dashboard presents insights such as the total number of cars sold, the fuel type of cars, the most popular car brands, the relationship between engine size, mileage, and price, and the year of manufacture for each sales year. The dashboard helps stakeholders to make data-driven decisions by visualizing and interpreting the sales trends, popular car models, and pricing patterns.
